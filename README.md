In this code you can find the solution to 3 different excersices wher we use some methods to produce a 95 % confidence interval for 2 datasets, the first is from the book  Computer Age Statistical Inference, page 162.

We also make an analysis to determine which model estimator is better.

To run the code is necessary make some changes in the paths of the linees, 7, 233, 310, 543. The first line, 7, is the path where you download the dataset student score, and the other lines, 233,310,543, is the path where you download the dataset diabetes. Both datasets can be found in the repository.
